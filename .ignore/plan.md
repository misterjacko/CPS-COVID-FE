# the plan

fetch data daily (or more) from [cps sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMtr8hhhKjPyyNg7i6V52iMQXEqa67E9iAmECeOqZ6c/edit#gid=1493210012)

### questions
 
how should data be stored? 

one csv per school:
pros. could do granular details. ie. new cases reported per day and calculate off of that for totals, 7 day average 21 day average etc. 
cons. A lot more stuff to deal with. that would be 500 files. each needing to be updated every day or multiple times per day. not great. 

one csv per day. 

pros 
that is how the data comes.
