                    <p class="faq-question">Q. Where do you get your data from?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. I get my data from CPS. The webpage with their summary is <a href="https://www.cps.edu/school-reopening-2020/">here</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-blue-100 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. How often does your data get updated?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. This site automatically collects updated data from CPS every five minutes and posts updates 
                        (if there are any) a few seconds later.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-blue-200 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. Why are there some days with 0 cases?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. If CPS has not made any changes to their data at that time, new case numbers for that day will be 0.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-blue-100 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. How long does it take between a case being reported to CPS and it showing up here?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. Based on what I have seen, it has historically taken about 2 days between a case being reported to CPS, 
                        it being investigated, deciding it is "actionable," informing relevant parties, and it showing up in their daily numbers. 
                        However, it has also taken a week or more to show up in their data. If you dont like that, know that I dont like it either. 
                        Let CPS know they shouldn't be so slow.</p>

                <div class="bg-blue-200 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. I was told by my school that there was a case and it has not shown up here!</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. CPS <em>should</em> be letting potenitally exposed schools and pods know about exposures before the rest of the world. 
                        However, if you are informed of a case in your school and do not see it here within a couple days, please let me know!</p>

                <div class="bg-blue-100 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. Why are there sometimes negative cases?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. If CPS removes a case from their dataset I will report it as a negative case.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-blue-200 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. Can I report a case to you directly?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. No!  Please report directly to CPS by using their (not very easy to find) self-report form 
                        <a href="https://chicagopsprod.service-now.com/health?id=cps_self_report">here</a>.</p>

                <div class="bg-blue-100 rounded">
                    <p class="faq-question">Q. Why are you doing this?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. I don't think CPS's data is organized in a very user friendly format. So I am using their data to make my own dashboard.</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">Q. What if I only care about my child's school?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">A. Once you go to a certain schools page, you can just bookmark that page and easliy go straight there.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">A. I would love to hear how you use this and what things you think would make it better or more useful!
