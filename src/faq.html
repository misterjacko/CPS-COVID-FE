            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. Where do you get your data from?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. I get my data from CPS. The webpage with their summary is <a href="https://www.cps.edu/school-reopening-2020/">here</a> and the data is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMtr8hhhKjPyyNg7i6V52iMQXEqa67E9iAmECeOqZ6c">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. How often does your data get updated?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. This site automatically collects updated data from CPS every every night (including holidays and weekends) at midnight.</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. Why are there some days with 0 cases?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. If CPS has not made any changes to their data at that time, new case numbers for that day will be 0.</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. How long does it take between a case being reported to CPS and it showing up here?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. Based on what I have seen, it has historically taken about 2 days between a case being reported to CPS, it being investigated, deciding it is "actionable," informing relevant parties, and it showing up in their daily numbers.</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. I was told by my school that there was a case and it has not shown up here!</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. CPS <em>should</em> be letting potenitally exposed schools and pods about exposures before the rest of the world. However, if you are informed of a case in your school and do not see it here within a day or so, please let me know!</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. Why are there days where there are no cases and then a lot of cases?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. I only update when CPS does. If it takes CPS three extra days to update their data, it might be three days worth of data.</p>
            <p class="faq-question">Q. Can I report a case to you directly?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">A. Heavens no!  Please report directly to CPS by using their (not very easy to find) self-report form <a href="https://chicagopsprod.service-now.com/health?id=cps_self_report">here</a>.</p>
